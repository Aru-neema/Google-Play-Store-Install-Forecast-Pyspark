# Google-Play-Store-Install-Forecast-Pyspark

After reading the documentation, the audience (advanced data Science students, aspirational data analyst) will know how to do the following tasks:

* Analyze data using pyspark

Project Background- The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of downloads for apps available on the Google Play Store based on genres, sizes and other attributes

Case Steps
Following steps are taken to solve this case

1.1 Read the data, preprocess them to select correct variables and variable type. Then do the exploratory data analysis (Univariate and Bi-variate analysis).

1.2 For supervised modelling the data would be divided into training, testing and validation datasets and then model regression, deciasion tree, random forest and gradient boost

1.3 Apply PCA and apply apriori rules to suggest strong associations between certain genres and their co-occurrence in high download applications

Expected Outcome:
To come up with combinations of variables that affects the number of downloads of the game. 

Data Understanding
The dataset has around 7800 rows and 13 columns.

Data preparation
Code Used: Python, R

Python Version: 3.8.8

Python Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Pyspark
